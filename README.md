# FastAPI Loki Observability Suite

**Production-ready Python/FastAPI Observability Stack**

This module provides end-to-end logging, tracing, and monitoring for Python microservices using:

- **Grafana Loki** (log aggregation, querying)
- **Grafana Alloy** (log shipping, enrichment)
- **OpenTelemetry Collector** (distributed tracing, metrics)
- **Grafana Tempo** (distributed tracing, trace storage, and search)
- **FastAPI** (microservice framework)
- **Docker Compose** (orchestration)
- **Pytest & Pydantic** (testing, type safety)

## üöÄ Features

- Secure, environment-variable-driven configuration (no hardcoded secrets)
- CI/CD optimized, ephemeral test environments
- Strict type validation with Pydantic
- End-to-end and integration tests for log ingestion and query
- TLS/HTTPS, multi-tenant, and admin API scenarios
- Ready for cloud, Kubernetes, or local Docker Compose
- **Tempo support:** Easily enable distributed tracing and trace search for FastAPI and Python apps

## üß© Tempo Support (Distributed Tracing)

**Grafana Tempo** enables full distributed tracing for your Python/FastAPI microservices:

- Collects traces from OpenTelemetry SDKs, FastAPI middleware, and instrumented libraries.
- Stores and indexes traces for search and correlation with logs (Loki) and metrics (Prometheus).
- Visualize traces and spans in Grafana dashboards for root cause analysis and performance monitoring.

**How to Enable Tempo:**

1. Uncomment the Tempo stage in the [Dockerfile](./docker/poetry/Dockerfile) and provide a production-ready `tempo-config.yaml`.
2. Expose ports 3200 (Tempo API) and 4317 (OTLP gRPC) as needed.
3. Ensure your FastAPI or Python app is instrumented with OpenTelemetry SDKs:
   ```python
   from opentelemetry import trace
   from opentelemetry.instrumentation.fastapi import FastAPIInstrumentor
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   app = FastAPI()
   FastAPIInstrumentor.instrument_app(app)
   # Configure exporters to point to your Tempo endpoint
   ```
4. Set the OTLP exporter endpoint to point to your running Tempo instance (e.g., `TEMPO_EXPORTER_ENDPOINT`).
5. View, search, and correlate traces in Grafana.

**Trace Use Cases:**

- End-to-end request tracing across microservices
- Root cause analysis for latency and errors
- Correlate logs, metrics, and traces for unified observability

## üì¶ Usage

1. **Clone this repo or add as a submodule.**
2. Copy and configure the example Docker Compose and config files for your environment.
3. Set environment variables for all secrets and endpoints (see `.env.example`).
4. Launch the stack:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.test.yml --profile observability up -d
   ```
5. Run tests:
   ```bash
   pytest _tests/
   ```

## üìö Documentation

- See [`_docs/best_practices/`](./_docs/best_practices/) for integration, config, and security guidance.
- Example configs: [`docker/`](./docker/)
- Test suite: [`_tests/`](./_tests/)

## üõ°Ô∏è Production-Readiness

- All configurations are type-checked and validated.
- No secrets are hardcoded; all sensitive data is environment-driven.
- Tests are deterministic, isolated, and CI/CD compatible.
