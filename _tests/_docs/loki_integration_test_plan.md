# Loki, Grafana Alloy, and OpenTelemetry Integration Test Plan

This document outlines a robust test strategy for validating the integration of Loki, Grafana Alloy, and OpenTelemetry Collector in a modern observability stack. It includes best practices for testing log ingestion, security, and end-to-end workflows.

---

## 1. Test Suite Structure

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Validate configuration parsing for Loki, Alloy, and Otel Collector.
  - Mock log shippers and exporters to test pipeline logic in isolation.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - End-to-end log flow from application/container to Loki via Alloy and Otel Collector.
  - Validate log labels, retention, and queryability in Grafana.
  - Test SSL/TLS and authentication scenarios.
- **E2E/Smoke Tests:**
  - Simulate real log generation (e.g., using k6 or custom scripts) and verify logs appear in Grafana dashboards.
  - Test multi-tenant and multi-source scenarios.

---

## 2. Key Test Scenarios

### A. Grafana Alloy
- Validate log shipping from Docker, file, and syslog sources.
- Test dynamic label enrichment and relabeling.
- Simulate config reloads and failure recovery.
- Verify log delivery to Loki (success/failure, retries, backoff).

### B. OpenTelemetry Collector
- Test filelog, otlp, and syslog receivers.
- Validate Loki exporter config (endpoint, tenant, TLS).
- Simulate pipeline errors and verify error handling.
- Test log format parsing (JSON, logfmt, plain text).

### C. Loki
- Verify log ingestion, retention, and deletion (TTL).
- Test authentication, multi-tenant, and admin API scenarios.
- Validate log queries (LogQL) for accuracy and performance.
- Simulate high-ingest and failover scenarios.

### D. Grafana (UI)
- Automated UI tests for log search, filtering, and dashboard visualization.
- Validate alerting and annotation features.

---

## 3. Security & Compliance Testing
- Test SSL/TLS for all endpoints (self-signed and CA-issued certs).
- Validate secrets and credentials are never logged or exposed.
- Test role-based access and multi-tenant isolation.
- Simulate log injection and verify sanitization.

---

## 4. Best Practices for Testing Loki & Observability Stacks
- Use ephemeral test environments (Docker Compose or Kubernetes Kind).
- Always clean up test data/logs after test runs.
- Prefer E2E tests that check real log delivery and queryability.
- Use synthetic log generators (k6, logcli, custom scripts) for reproducible tests.
- Monitor for flaky tests and ensure all tests are deterministic.
- Validate performance under load (load testing for Loki ingestion and query).
- Automate test execution in CI/CD pipelines.

---

## 5. Example Test Tools & Frameworks
- **Pytest, Go test:** for unit/integration tests.
- **k6, logcli:** for log generation and query testing.
- **Playwright, Selenium:** for Grafana UI automation.
- **Testcontainers:** for ephemeral stack orchestration.
- **Prometheus:** for monitoring test environment health.

---

## 6. Sample Test Workflow
1. Stand up ephemeral stack (Loki, Alloy, Otelcol, Grafana) via Compose.
2. Generate logs via synthetic app or k6.
3. Assert logs are ingested by Loki and visible in Grafana.
4. Run LogQL queries and validate results.
5. Tear down and clean up all test data.

> **Tip:** Always keep test environments isolated, automate test execution, and ensure logs/metrics are cleaned up after each run for reliable, reproducible results.
